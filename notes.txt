improvements for code:

1. fix discrepancies between modules (startDate/endDate vs first/last, dataVals vs datavals)
code seems to work anyway but this is very confusing in the documentation (unless this was intentional for some reason?)

2. hide methods/functions not intended for the user in Databank.py so that help(databank) isn't so verbose

3. consider impact of Dos vs Unix carriage returns in data file for databank_io.py





improvements for documentation: 

1. find a solution for what to call the "user/model" (the thing that will be calling databank) i tried to make a note of it in the foreward.  maybe this is good enough.

2. more concise summary of databank in section 4

3. better formatting (LaTex)

4. stop using sooooo many parenthesese (James!)
